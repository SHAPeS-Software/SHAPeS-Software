# `Hello!`
I like writing things a metal box that makes it do stuff! I'm still learning to program (mostly for the web).

## I'm currently learning
![C](https://github.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/blob/master/src/c/c.png) C
![OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-logo/blob/master/Colour/PNG/colour-logo.png) OCaml

## Languages I want to try
![ruby](https://github.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/blob/master/src/ruby/ruby_32x32.png) Ruby
![swift](https://github.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/blob/master/src/swift/swift_32x32.png) Swift
